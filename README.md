MB Custom Headlines 3
=====================

##Version 1.2.4 - Jun 2, 2014

* New feature: More stories link. It's available under custom properties.
* Fixed CSS issue with full-width image mode and images breaking out of their containers.

##Version 1.2.3 - May 31, 2014

* Added new custom property css_classes. This allows you to add whatever custom classes you like to the block. This replicates the functionality of the one built into Blox except that it'll respect when the block has no assets. That means, if you apply a padding class to a block that sometimes appears devoid of assets, you won't have extra white space hanging around on the page.

##Requirements

* TownNews Blox CMS
* Compass for compiling the SCSS file
* There are several macros necessary to make this block work on your system. You can either replace them with the core_base_library macros from TownNews or you can contact me to get the custom macros.
